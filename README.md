# AlmaLinux OS Cloud Images

AlmaLinux OS Cloud Images is a project that contains
[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) templates and other tools for building
AlmaLinux OS images for various cloud platforms.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add aarch64 architecture support
* [x] Vagrant + VirtualBox support
* [x] Vagrant + VMWare support
* [ ] Vagrant + Parallels support (#3)
* [x] Vagrant + Microsoft Hyper-V support (#4)
* [x] Vagrant + Libvirt support
* [x] AWS support (using the VMWare builder only, it would be nice to support VirtualBox or Qemu as well)
* [x] Google Cloud support
* [ ] Microsoft Azure support (#14)
* [x] DigitalOcean support
* [x] Generic Cloud / OpenStack support (#12)
* [x] LXC/LXD support (#8)


## Usage

Initialize Packer plugins:

```sh
$ packer init .
```


### Build a Vagrant Box

Build a VirtualBox box:

```sh
$ packer build -only=virtualbox-iso.almalinux-8 .
```

Build a VMWare box:

```sh
$ packer build -only=vmware-iso.almalinux-8 .
```

Build a Libvirt box:

```sh
$ packer build -only=qemu.almalinux-8 .
```

Build a Hyper-V box:

```powershell
> packer build -only="hyperv-iso.almalinux-8" .
```


### Build an Amazon AMI

Before building AMI's you need to configure AWS credentials as described in
the Packer [documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon#environment-variables).
Basically, you need to define the following environment variables:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='ENTER_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='ENTER_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE'
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='us-east-1'
```

Also, you need to create an S3 bucket that Packer will use for temporary image
storing before importing it into EC2. It's strongly recommended creating the
bucket in the `us-east-1` region if you are going to submit your images to the
Amazon Marketplace. Accordingly to Amazon's [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/product-submission.html#submitting-amis-to-aws-marketplace),
the self-service AMI scanner supports only that region.

After configuring the AWS credentials and creating the S3 bucket, run the
following command to build an AMI and import it to EC2:

```sh
$ packer build -var aws_s3_bucket_name="YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME" -only=vmware-iso.almalinux-8-aws .
```

If you are using a non-standard [role name](https://www.packer.io/docs/post-processors/amazon#role_name),
it's possible to define it as a variable:

```sh
$ packer build -var aws_s3_bucket_name="YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME" \
               -var aws_role_name="YOUR_IAM_ROLE_NAME" -only=vmware-iso.almalinux-8-aws .
```


### Build a DigitalOcean image

As with the Amazon AMI, you need to install and configure DigitalOcean credentials for `doctl`; as described in the relevant
[documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/).

Now, you can use the provided script to pull the latest Generic Cloud image to DigitalOcean:

```sh
$ bin/digitalocean-import_latest_image.bash
```

This process takes around 5 minutes. Be sure to check with `doctl compute image list` and make sure your image is listed before
proceeding.

The script will write `.env.digitalocean` which, when sourced, will provide one of the required environment variables for this
procedure: `DIGITALOCEAN_IMAGE`.

```sh
$ source .env.digitalocean
```

You can set this one manually as well:

```sh
$ export DIGITALOCEAN_IMAGE='YOUR_IMAGE_ID_GOES_HERE'
```

Now, you need to setup a key for packer to use. This is done by going to DigitalOcean's [cloud
console](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens).

Make it available through an environment variable:

```sh
$ export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN="ENTER_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"
```

Now, you're all setup. You can try building the image with:

```sh
$ packer build -only do.almalinux-8-digitalocean-x86_64 .
```

For simplicity, the whole procedure looks like:

```sh
# get the image
$ bin/digitalocean-import_latest_image.bash

# set the image ID
$ source .env.digitalocean

# verify the new Generic Cloud image is in place
$ doctl compute image list

# set your packer token
$ export DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN="ENTER_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"

# build image
$ packer build -only digitalocean.almalinux-8-digitalocean-x86_64 .
```


### Build a Generic Cloud (OpenStack compatible) image

```sh
$ packer build -only qemu.almalinux-8-gencloud-x86_64 .
```
